About Pixel

Pixel Race  is a play-to-earn NFT horse racing metaverse where you can participate in horse races, breed NFT horses with unique characteristics, build your own NFT hippodrome and make profit while doing it.

NFT horses

One of a kind horses that differ in both traits (rarity, performance, cool-down time) and visual appearances.

Horse races

Horse races are based on RNG technology. The winner gets % of all participant fees and additional prizes.

NFT Hippodromes

Horse races take place in hippodromes owned by bookmakers. Bookmakers make a profit from entrance fees.

In-Game Horse Marketplace

NFT horses can be bought and sold both in the DeRace marketplace or in any other NFT marketplaces.

With our developed project, we will include you in this excitement by using VR first and then AR technology in hippodromes.
